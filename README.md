This is a simple python program that automatically mutes selected programs when they are unfocussed, this was initially developed for Tekken 8 so that is the current default but the selected program can be changed where it is marked in the file.
This is the 1st public project that I have done that im happy for other people to use but as a inexperienced developer any performance or security issues may have been overlooked so please use with caution
Any feedback would be appreciated :D

TODO:
Add gui showing currently running programs that the user can select to be added to the mute list
